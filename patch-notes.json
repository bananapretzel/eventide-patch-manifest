The new ceiling is 3.75. This will unlikely effect regular player damage unless extremely geared and with perfect party compositions. The main goal of this is many weaponskills have attack modifiers which could not break through this ceiling resulting in many weaponskills having lower than expected damage output. \n\n[Mobs]\nMob TP gain formula has been adjusted. Previously all attacks would have a (baseTP +30) so 1 handers that attack fast proc the additional +30 significantly more often than 2 handers. This has been dialed back to +10 to see how this feels.\n\nMob TP usage formula has been updated. Previously mobs would have immediate WS usage under these criteria.\n100% to 51% HP with 3k TP.\n50% to 26% with 2k TP.\n1%-25% with 1k TP.\nThis remains in place but there is another layer to add the potential for mob WS usage outside of this rigid system.\n\nIf a mob has 1k or more TP and the above criteria is not met there will be a chance (TP/150) to use a WS on an incremental server tick. IE. if a mob is at 83% HP and has 1749 TP it will be (1749/150) an 11.66% chance per server tick to use a WS. If the mob manages to reach 3k TP before the chance successfully procs it will then trigger a forced WS using previous code.\n\nThis should help with 2 things:\n[1] Previously if a mob is at 51% or higher its TP moves are all at 3k strength which is max modifiers for big potential dmg.\n[2] Reduce mob predictability.\n\nPlease provide feedback on player experience when interacting with the reduced mob TP gains and the additional potential for mobs to choose to use a WS.\n\n[Drops]\nThousand Eyes in King Ranperre's Tomb corrected to drop Burning Hakutaku Eye."
